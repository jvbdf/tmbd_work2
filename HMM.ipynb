    "### 1. Introduction to the Problem of Study\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial markets do not behave in a constant or predictable way. Instead, they move through periods of relative stability, where price changes are small, and periods of stronger turbulence, marked by sudden and irregular movements. These different phases are commonly known as volatility regimes. Identifying such regimes is important for understanding market behaviour and for practical tasks such as risk assessment and investment decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main challenges is that volatility regimes are not directly observable. Historical financial data usually provides daily prices, volumes, and returns, but there is no variable indicating whether the market was operating in a low-volatility phase, a transitional situation, or a period of extreme instability. The true state of the market is hidden, while only the resulting price movements can be measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "This work focuses on addressing this problem by analysing daily log-returns of a financial asset using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). An HMM is a probabilistic model designed to infer unobserved states from observed data. In this context, we assume that the market can be in one of three states—**low volatility**, **moderate volatility**, or **extreme volatility**, each one associated with different returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this study is to estimate how these hidden regimes evolve over time, to describe their properties, and to evaluate how effectively an HMM can detect transitions between them."

    "The aim of this project is to analyse the volatility behaviour of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) through a statistical model capable of identifying hidden market regimes. To achieve this, the approach is based on the use of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) applied to the daily log-returns of NVIDIA’s stock prices. The HMM framework is particularly suitable for this task, as it assumes that the observed data are generated by an unobserved sequence of latent states, each representing a different volatility regime.\n",
    "\n",
    "The methodology begins by collecting historical daily price data for NVIDIA from Yahoo Finance. From these prices, daily log-returns are computed, as they provide a more stable and statistically convenient representation of market fluctuations. These returns serve as the observable input to the HMM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model considered in this study assumes the existence of three latent regimes: **low volatility**, **moderate volatility**, and **extreme volatility**. Each regime is characterised by its own statistical distribution of returns, typically modelled as Gaussian with different variances. The parameters of the HMM — including the means and variances of each regime and the transition probabilities between regimes — are estimated using the Baum–Welch algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the model is fitted, the Viterbi algorithm is used to infer the most likely sequence of hidden volatility regimes over time. This allows the analysis of how NVIDIA’s stock transitions between calm periods(low volatility), transitional phases(moderate volatility), and high-turbulence episodes(extreme volatility). The results provide a structured way to interpret the evolution of NVIDIA’s volatility and to identify moments that correspond to significant market events or changes in investor behaviour."
