    "### 1. Introduction to the Problem of Study\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial markets do not behave in a constant or predictable way. Instead, they move through periods of relative stability, where price changes are small, and periods of stronger turbulence, marked by sudden and irregular movements. These different phases are commonly known as volatility regimes. Identifying such regimes is important for understanding market behaviour and for practical tasks such as risk assessment and investment decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main challenges is that volatility regimes are not directly observable. Historical financial data usually provides daily prices, volumes, and returns, but there is no variable indicating whether the market was operating in a low-volatility phase, a transitional situation, or a period of extreme instability. The true state of the market is hidden, while only the resulting price movements can be measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "This work focuses on addressing this problem by analysing daily log-returns of a financial asset using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). An HMM is a probabilistic model designed to infer unobserved states from observed data. In this context, we assume that the market can be in one of three states—**low volatility**, **moderate volatility**, or **extreme volatility**, each one associated with different returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this study is to estimate how these hidden regimes evolve over time, to describe their properties, and to evaluate how effectively an HMM can detect transitions between them."

    "The aim of this project is to analyse the volatility behaviour of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) through a statistical model capable of identifying hidden market regimes. To achieve this, the approach is based on the use of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) applied to the daily log-returns of NVIDIA’s stock prices. The HMM framework is particularly suitable for this task, as it assumes that the observed data are generated by an unobserved sequence of latent states, each representing a different volatility regime.\n",
    "\n",
    "The methodology begins by collecting historical daily price data for NVIDIA from Yahoo Finance. From these prices, daily log-returns are computed, as they provide a more stable and statistically convenient representation of market fluctuations. These returns serve as the observable input to the HMM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model considered in this study assumes the existence of three latent regimes: **low volatility**, **moderate volatility**, and **extreme volatility**. Each regime is characterised by its own statistical distribution of returns, typically modelled as Gaussian with different variances. The parameters of the HMM — including the means and variances of each regime and the transition probabilities between regimes — are estimated using the Baum–Welch algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the model is fitted, the Viterbi algorithm is used to infer the most likely sequence of hidden volatility regimes over time. This allows the analysis of how NVIDIA’s stock transitions between calm periods(low volatility), transitional phases(moderate volatility), and high-turbulence episodes(extreme volatility). The results provide a structured way to interpret the evolution of NVIDIA’s volatility and to identify moments that correspond to significant market events or changes in investor behaviour."

    "Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) were developed in the late 1960s through the work of Leonard E. Baum and colleagues, who introduced key algorithms such as Forward-Backward(Baum-Welch) method for parameter estimation and the Viterbi algorithm for decoding hidden states.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first applications of HMMs was speech recognition, starting in the mid-1970s. From the linguistics point of view, hidden Markov models are equivalent to stochastic regular grammar.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1990s, HMMs became popular in finance to model regime-switching behaviour in time series. Traditional linear models were insufficient to capture the frequent structural breaks and changing volatility observed in stock prices, interest rates, and exchange rates. HMMs offered a natural framework for representing these dynamics, where different market regimes (such as bull markets, bear markets, or high/low volatility periods) correspond to distinct hidden states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hamilton (1989) introduced regime-switching models that allow economic time series to exhibit different behaviours in different states, which closely relate to the HMM framework. Subsequent studies demonstrated that HMMs could effectively capture volatility clustering, fat tails, and other stylized facts of financial returns. By explicitly modelling unobservable market states, HMMs enable more accurate forecasting and risk assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowaday, HMMs continue to play a key role in both research and real-word applications. Their capacity to uncover hidden patterns from noisy data makes them especially valuable in context where financial information is becoming increasingly complex and high-dimensional."

    "### Hidden Markov Models: Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "A Hidden Markov Model is a statistical model that represents a system assumed to be a Markov process with unobserved (hidden) states. The model consists of two main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hidden States**: A sequence of latent states $X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_T$ that evolve over time according to a Markov property—the probability of transitioning to a new state depends only on the current state, not on past states.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Observations**: A sequence of observable outputs $Y_1, Y_2, \\ldots, Y_T$ where each observation is generated by the current hidden state according to an **emission probability distribution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of an HMM\n",
    "\n",
    "An HMM is fully specified by the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **States**: A finite set of $N$ hidden states ${x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_N}$\n",
    "- **Initial State Distribution** $\\pi$: The probability distribution over states at time $t=0$\n",
    "- **Transition Matrix** $A$: An $N \\times N$ matrix where $a_{ij}$ represents the probability of transitioning from state $i$ to state $j$\n",
    "- **Emission Probabilities** $B$: The probability distributions that govern how observations are generated from each state\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Three Fundamental Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "HMMs address three fundamental computational problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Evaluation Problem (Forward Algorithm)**  \n",
    "For a given model and a sequence of observations, the goal is to determine how likely is to obtain that sequence. it uses dynamic programming to aggregate probabilities over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Decoding Problem (Viterbi Algorithm)**  \n",
    "The objective is to recover the sequence of hidden states that best explains the observed data. The Viterbi algorithm computes this by finding the path with the highest probability, again relying in dynamic programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Learning Problem (Baum-Welch Algorithm)**  \n",
    "Given only observations, estimate the model parameters that maximize the likelihood of the data. The Baum-Welch algorithm is an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm that iteratively refines parameter estimates:\n",
    "- **E-step**: Compute expected state occupancies and transitions given current parameters\n",
    "- **M-step**: Update parameters to maximize likelihood given these expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application to Financial Volatility\n",
    "\n",
    "In financial applications, we model:\n",
    "- **Hidden states**: Different volatility regimes (low, moderate, extreme)\n",
    "- **Observations**: Daily log-returns of stock prices\n",
    "- **Emission distributions**: Gaussian distributions with different means and variances for each regime\n",
    "\n",
    "The transition matrix captures the tendency of markets to persist in a regime or switch between regimes. By estimating these parameters from historical data, we can:\n",
    "- Identify which regime the market was in at any point in time\n",
    "- Predict future regime transitions\n",
    "- Assess the risk profile of different market periods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computational Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithms scale as follows:\n",
    "- **Forward/Backward**: $O(N^2 T)$ where $N$ is the number of states and $T$ is the sequence length\n",
    "- **Viterbi**: $O(N^2 T)$\n",
    "- **Baum-Welch**: $O(I \\cdot N^2 T)$ where $I$ is the number of iterations\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes HMMs computationally efficient even for long time series with moderate numbers of states."
